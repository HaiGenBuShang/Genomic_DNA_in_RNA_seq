# Genomic_DNA_in_RNA_seq

#*******************************************************************************
#*The scripts provided here were used to reproduce all the steps of the research
#*done by Xiangnan Li, et al. that estimated genomic DNA contamination in RNA-seq
#*and checked the influence of gDNA contamination on RNA-seq gene expression.
#*******************************************************************************
To reproduce all the analyses in the article, you should simply:
1. cd scripts
2. excute ./Reads_mapping_and_gDNA_estimate.sh
After "mapping_to_genome_and_transcripts_assembling/gDNA_finished_or_not.log" was generated with the content "All gDNA_estimate.sh finished!", then
3. excute ./Impact_of_gDNA_on_expression.sh

Before you run the 2 scripts, make sure that:
1. download all the data, rename and move the data to the directory "$(pwd)/../../data"
2. provided the path of HISAT2 indexes to the "ref_dir" variable in the "mapping_to_genome_and_transcripts_assembling/gDNA_estimate.sh" scripts
3. provided the file path of the gtf file to the "gencode_gtf" variable in the "mapping_to_genome_and_transcripts_assembling/gDNA_estimate.sh" scripts
4. cd to "scripts" directory
5. derectly run the script "./Reads_mapping_and_gDNA_estimate.sh"
6. you may check if commands called by "Reads_mapping_and_gDNA_estimate.sh" finished by checking 
if "mapping_to_genome_and_transcripts_assembling/gDNA_finished_or_not.log" was generated and with the content "All gDNA_estimate.sh finished!"
7. edit the first column of "gene_expression_and_impcats_of_gDNA/all_ballgown_dir.txt", this column means the mapping results directory name in the "/../../data/results/mapping/" drectory,
you should make sure the mapping results directory name correspond to the second column.
8. after the commands called by "Reads_mapping_and_gDNA_estimate.sh" finished, run the script "./Impact_of_gDNA_on_expression.sh"
9. all the result files could be found in "../results/"

#***************************************
##*Estimate gDNA and FPKM caused by gDNA
##**************************************
Two scripts were provided to estimate gDNA contamination "Estimate_gDNA_contamination.sh" and FPKM caused by gDNA "FPKM_caused_by_gDNA.sh".
You can use the two script directly. The two files used in the two scripts could be generated during your reproduction of this study.

#************************
#*YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT!!!
#************************
The whole project contain 48 sequenced samples, however, results from only 32 samples were used in this research.
To reporduce the results, you should download all the 48 samples, and rename your files to the original file names.
The original file names could be found in "mapping_to_genome_and_transcripts_assembling/original_fastq_files.txt".
If you only download the 32 samples, you should add some "fake" samples so that totally 48 samples.
Why to do this is that in the R code, I select the 32 samples by their file name orders not by their file names and this selection would not influence the results.

Always, rename all your downloaded file names to the original file names.

If you have any problem with these scripts, contact me directly.

##*Known bugs!!!
##**************
1. when you run the script "Reads_mapping_and_gDNA_estimate.sh", sometimes the scripts "intergenic_region/produce_intergenic_region_bed.sh" would occur error which lead to an empty intergenic bed file, 
thus resulted in wrong counting of reads in intergenic region. If this happens, you should comment the line 23 of the script "mapping_to_genome_and_transcripts_assembling/gDNA_estimate.sh", and 
rerun "Reads_mapping_and_gDNA_estimate.sh". The rest steps would not consume much time.
